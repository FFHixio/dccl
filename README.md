# DCCL

The Dynamic Compact Control Language (DCCL) is a marshalling and protocol language for very low throughput links (e.g. acoustic, satellite, low frequency radio). Formerly part of Goby (https://launchpad.net/goby) for releases 1 and 2, we believe DCCL has reached a level of maturity that it can be more easily standardized, adopted, and maintained as a separate project.
